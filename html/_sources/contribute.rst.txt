We welcome contributions from the community. Please see the
`contributor guidelines <https://github.com/TCKDB/TCKDB/wiki/Contributor-Guidelines>`_
on TCKDB's GitHub page, as well as the
`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/TCKDB/TCKDB/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.


It is recommended to open an issue on GitHub, notifying the developers on a bug
you are trying to fix or a feature you plan to implement
(see our `Roadmap <https://github.com/TCKDB/TCKDB/wiki/Roadmap>`_)
to avoid duplicate work.
