The **TCKDB â€“ Theoretical Chemical Kinetics Database** project is intended to support the international chemical kinetics community by addressing a necessity to standardize data and make it conveniently available for all.
As such, the goal of the TCKDB projects is to establish a standardized open infrastructure
for conveniently storing and attaining theoretical chemical information of relevance for
kinetics computations.

The frst stage of developing TCKDB was supported by an NSF grant (grant number OAC-1547580).

TCKDB is currently developed and maintained by the [Dana Research Group](https://dana.net.technion.ac.il/)
at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.

International collaborators include researchers from the following institutions:

*   Argonne National Laboratories
*   Georgia University
*   Ghent University
*   Massachusetts Institute of Technology
*   Molecular Scientific Software Institute
*   National Renewable Energy Laboratory
*   Northeastern University
*   Polytechnic University of Milan
*   Technion - Israel Institute of Technology
*   U.S. Army Research Laboratories
