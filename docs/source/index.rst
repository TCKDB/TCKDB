The **TCKDB -- Theoretical Chemical Kinetics Database** project
is intended to support the international chemical kinetics community
by addressing a necessity to standardize data and make it conveniently available for all.

As such, the goal of the TCKDB projects is to establish a standardized open infrastructure for conveniently
storing and attaining theoretical chemical information of relevance for kinetics computations.

TCKDB is currently being built. Once this service becomes available to the international community
a detailed explanation of how to store and retrieve data will be added here.

The code is hosted on GitHub_, which is where comments, issues, and community
contributions are welcomed.

The following documentation pages describe how to interface with
TCKDB's API, and how to contribute to this project.
