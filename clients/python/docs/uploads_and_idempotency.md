# Raw uploads, idempotency keys and contribution bundles

## Authenticated upload

`upload()` accepts:

- a known short name from `UPLOAD_ENDPOINTS`
  (`conformer`, `reaction`, `kinetics`, `thermo`, `statmech`,
  `transport`, `transition_state`, `network`, `network_pdep`,
  `computed_reaction`),
- an explicit path beginning with `/`
  (e.g. `/uploads/some-future-endpoint`),
- or an absolute URL for advanced use.

Unknown short names are rejected client-side — `upload("thermos", ...)`
fails fast rather than silently posting to `/uploads/thermos`.

```python
from tckdb_client import TCKDBClient

with TCKDBClient(base_url, api_key=api_key) as client:
    # preferred: known short name
    client.upload("thermo", payload, idempotency_key="mytool:job-123:thermo:eth")

    # forward-compatible: explicit path for future endpoints
    client.upload("/uploads/some-future-endpoint", payload)
```

## Idempotency keys

Retry-safe writes use the conventional `Idempotency-Key` header. Build a
generic key with the helper, or supply your own opaque string (16-200
chars, `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`):

```python
from tckdb_client import make_idempotency_key

key = make_idempotency_key("mytool", "job-123", "thermo", "ethanol")
client.upload("thermo", payload, idempotency_key=key)
```

### Caveat: `make_idempotency_key` sanitizes parts

`make_idempotency_key(*parts)` replaces any character outside
`[A-Za-z0-9._:-]` with `-` so callers don't have to pre-sanitize labels
like `"n-butane (s)"`. **This is lossy.** Two distinct logical inputs
that differ only in disallowed characters collapse to the same key:

```python
make_idempotency_key("foo bar", ...)   # -> "foo-bar:..."
make_idempotency_key("foo-bar", ...)   # -> "foo-bar:..."  (collision!)
```

For most v0 producers (a single tool naming jobs from its own ID space)
that's fine. Producer adapters that need stronger uniqueness guarantees
should either pass pre-normalized parts or append a stable payload-hash
suffix:

```python
key = make_idempotency_key("arc", job_id, output_kind, stable_payload_hash[:12])
```

The server treats the key as opaque — it never parses structure — so
adding a hash suffix is purely a producer-side strengthening.

To detect whether the server **replayed** a stored response (rather than
re-executing the write), use the lower-level wrapper:

```python
response = client.request_json(
    "POST", "/uploads/thermo", json=payload, idempotency_key=key,
)
if response.idempotency_replayed:
    print("server replayed a prior response")
print(response.data)
```

## Contribution bundles

```python
preview = client.bundle_dry_run(bundle)
result  = client.bundle_submit(bundle, idempotency_key=key)
```
