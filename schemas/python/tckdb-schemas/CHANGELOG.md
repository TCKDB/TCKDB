## 0.49.0 - 2026-09-24

Stop defaulting `reference_pressure_bar` to 1 bar on computed thermo uploads
(issue #529). ARC computes entropy at 1 atm via a hardcoded translational
partition function and records no pressure anywhere in its output, so the
default was stamping every computed deposit with a standard state its own
numbers were not computed at. An omitted pressure now stays unrecorded, for
every scientific origin. `phase` keeps defaulting to `gas` for computed
uploads: unlike the pressure convention, gas is a direct consequence of the
ideal-gas statistical mechanics every current computed producer uses, not
an arbitrary convention a producer could plausibly have gotten wrong.
Existing stored records still carry the old 1 bar default; correcting them
is a separate, undecided question.

## 0.47.0 - 2026-09-23

Explicit enthalpy reference declarations for thermo deposits and grouped reference reads.
No inferred defaults or legacy backfill.
