# tckdb-schemas

Pure Pydantic wire-contract schemas for TCKDB upload payloads.

This package exposes TCKDB's published upload request bodies (plus their
direct dependency closure) so external workflow tools and clients can
validate TCKDB public upload payloads without installing the full backend
(FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, RDKit, etc.).

| Route | Request model |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/uploads/computed-species` | `ComputedSpeciesUploadRequest` |
| `POST /api/v1/uploads/computed-reaction` | `ComputedReactionUploadRequest` |
| `POST /api/v1/uploads/conformers` | `ConformerUploadRequest` |
| `POST /api/v1/uploads/transition-states` | `TransitionStateUploadRequest` |

All four are importable straight from `tckdb_schemas.workflows`.

Stability: the schemas mirror the backend's wire contract. Until the
TCKDB API hits 1.0, expect coordinated bumps with the backend. A contract
that lives here can be pinned, and a breaking change to it forces a
version bump a consumer can act on — which is the reason to put it here
rather than inside the server.

## Changelog

### 0.24.0 — **BREAKING**: statmech source calculations are named, not numbered

`ConformerUploadRequest.statmech` used to identify a supporting
calculation by its database primary key. It no longer does, and payloads
written against 0.23.0 that used those two fields will be rejected with a
422 rather than silently reinterpreted.

| Before (0.23.0) | After (0.24.0) |
|---|---|
| `statmech.source_calculations[].calculation_id: int` | `statmech.source_calculations[].calculation_key: str` |
| `statmech.torsions[].source_scan_calculation_id: int \| None` | `statmech.torsions[].source_scan_calculation_key: str \| None` |

A key names a calculation *declared in the same request*. To make that
possible, `ConformerUploadRequest.calculation` and
`additional_calculations[]` gained an optional `key`, and the request
refuses a statmech reference to a key nobody declared. This is the shape
the computed-species / computed-reaction bundles have always used; the
conformer path was the odd one out, and a row id is not something a
depositor can know.

Migrating: put a `key` on the calculation you meant, and reference it.

```python
# 0.23.0 — only writable by something that had already queried TCKDB
{"calculation": {...}, "statmech": {"source_calculations": [{"calculation_id": 4711, "role": "freq"}]}}

# 0.24.0
{"calculation": {"key": "h_sp", ...},
 "additional_calculations": [{"key": "h_freq", "type": "freq", ...}],
 "statmech": {"source_calculations": [{"calculation_key": "h_freq", "role": "freq"}]}}
```

Component renames (they affect generated client class names; the JSON
shape of the bundle paths is unchanged):

- `StatmechSourceCalculationCreate`, `StatmechSourceCalcInBundle` and the
  server-side `StatmechSourceCalculationIn` collapse into one component,
  `StatmechSourceCalcIn`. The old names remain importable as aliases.
- `StatmechTorsionCreate` collapses into `StatmechTorsionIn`.
- `StatmechTorsionCoordinateCreate` and `StatmechTorsionCoordinateBase`
  are gone; `StatmechTorsionCoordinateIn` is the only spelling of an atom
  quartet. They were field-for-field and validator-for-validator
  identical, so a generator emitted two classes for one concept.
- New: `ConformerCalculationIn` — a `CalculationWithResultsPayload` plus
  the optional `key`.

Also tightened, matching what the sibling upload paths already enforce:
`statmech.source_calculations` must be unique by
`(calculation_key, role)` (it is the row's primary key, so a duplicate
used to surface as a 500), and `statmech.torsions[].torsion_index` must
be unique.

### 0.23.0

Published `ConformerUploadRequest` and `TransitionStateUploadRequest`.

## Installation (development)

From the repo root:

```bash
pip install -e schemas/python/tckdb-schemas
```

## Usage

```python
from tckdb_schemas.workflows.computed_species_upload import (
    ComputedSpeciesUploadRequest,
)

payload = ComputedSpeciesUploadRequest.model_validate(data)
wire = payload.model_dump(mode="json", exclude_none=True)
```

## Boundary

`tckdb_schemas` must not import FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, RDKit, or
any backend `app.*` module. The package depends only on `pydantic` plus
the standard library. The boundary is enforced by
`tests/test_import_boundaries.py`.
